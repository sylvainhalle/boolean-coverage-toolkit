WARNING
-------

The artifacts inside this virtual machine purposefully omit any explicit
information that could identify the authors, to follow the double-blind
evaluation policy that appies to all submitted material. **Any affiliation
information that may be directly observed pertains to auxiliary third-party
material software and libraries. These are NOT linked to the authors of the
paper.**

However, source and binary files inside the runnable JAR file DO reveal the
authors' affiliation. Beware if you attempt to open the contents of the JAR file
to inspect its contents. Re-generating the results presented in the paper,
however, is possible without this being disclosed, read on.

Description
-----------

This archive contains an instance of LabPal, an environment for running
experiments on a computer and collecting their results in a user-friendly way.
The author of this archive has set up a set of experiments, which typically
involve running scripts on input data, processing their results and displaying
them in tables and plots. LabPal is a library that wraps around these
experiments and displays them in an easy-to-use web interface. The principle
behind LabPal is that all the necessary code, libraries and input data should be
bundled within a single self-contained JAR file, such that anyone can download
and easily reproduce someone else's experiments.

All the plots and other data values mentioned in the paper are automatically
generated by the execution of this lab. The lab also provides additional tables
and plots that could not fit into the manuscript. Detailed instructions can be
found on the LabPal website, [https://liflab.github.io/labpal]

Running LabPal
--------------

To start the lab, open a terminal window and type at the command line:

    java -jar boolean-coverage-lab.jar --autostart

You should see something like this:

    LabPal 2.8 - A versatile environment for running experiments
    (C) 2014-2017 Laboratoire d'informatique formelle
    Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, Canada
    Please visit http://localhost:21212/index to run this lab
    Hit Ctrl+C in this window to stop

Open the web browser (either Midori or TazWeb, found in the "Internet" menu),
and type `http://localhost:21212/index` in the address bar. This should lead you
to the main page of LabPal's web control panel.

Using the web interface
-----------------------

A detailed explanation on the use of the LabPal web interface can be found
in this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uL7i6SytyM. A lab is
made of a set of *experiments*, each corresponding to a specific set of
instructions that runs and generates a subset of all the benchmark's
results. Results from experiments are collected and processed into various
auto-generated tables and plots.

The lab is instructed to immediately start running all the expermients it
contains. You can follow the progress of these experiments by going to the
Status page and refreshing it periodically. At any point, you can look at
the results of the experiments that have run so far. You can do so by:

- Going to the Plots (5th button in the top menu) or the Tables (6th button)
  page and see the plots and tables created for this lab being updated in real
  time
- Going back to the list of experiments, clicking on one of them and getting
  the detailed description and data points that this experiment has
  generated

Once the assistant is done, you can export any of the plots and tables to a
file, or the raw data points by using the Export button in the Status page.

Formulas included in the benchmark
----------------------------------

The Home page of the lab provides more details about the benchmark. In
particular, the list of all Boolean formulas included in the benchmark can be
obtained by visiting http://localhost:21212/formulas inside the browser.

Comparing results from the paper
--------------------------------

An interesting feature of LabPal, described in this other YouTube video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StXflS52h4s), is that it exports its
results directly into a research paper. If you look at the PDF of the paper,
you will see that the plots and some other elements in the text are
hyperlinks. These links can be used to fetch the corresponding plot or data
element inside the running LabPal instance.

For example, locate Figure 6 and hover your mouse over it. You should see that
this plot has a hyperlink with text "P16.0". Copy that link, and then go to the
LabPal console in the browser and click on the "Find" button (rightmost button
in the top bar). Paste the text "P16.0" in the search bar and click on "Find".
You should be taken directly to the plot that corresponds to Figure 6 in the
paper, and visually compare the two. (Make sure that the lab has finished
running before making this comparison, otherwise what you will see is a partial
plot with whatever results have been generated so far.)

You can check for other elements in the paper with similar hyperlinks. For
example, on page 9, the value "1.23x" is also a hyperlink ("M11.0"). This
corresponds to a value that was computed in the lab and inserted directly
into the text in the form of a macro. Search for M11.0 in the lab using the
same technique as above; you should be taken to the Macros page, where the
value that appears in the paper is highlighted (and hopefully, should be the
same!).

All parts of the paper that refer to experimental data are linked to the lab in
such a way, making it possible to cross-check all the claims referring to this
data. Running times, obviously, are machine-dependent, but the trends should
still hold even though the absolute quantities are different.
